# Using Code to Deploy, Secure, and Manage Repositories

Storing code and other artifacts into a repository backed by a version control system (VCS) is a fairly well understood and agreed upon technique. However, many organizations I work with are still creating and managing repositories by hand or with one-off scripts. While this method does work, and is often good for beginners to get a grasp on the fundamentals, there are challenges with scale, consistency, security, and cleanup. It is far more powerful to use code to deploy, secure, and manage repositories.
